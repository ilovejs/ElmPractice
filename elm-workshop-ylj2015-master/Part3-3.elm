-- Want more?
-- If you would like to explore this example further, a good first step is to make it match the original Pong game
-- found on the Elm website. To reach parity, try and implement:
--   1. The ability to pause the game by pressing SPACE
--   2. Displaying of scores
-- more at: http://elm-lang.org/blog/Pong.elm
